These files contain the code used for analyses included in the publication Gay CM, et al. Patterns of transcription factor programs and immune pathway activation define four major subtypes of SCLC with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Publication date to be determined.

These files include the code associated with the following:
- non-negative matrix factorization analysis of SCLC tumor transcriptional data (as used Figures 1A-B, 1F, Supplementary Figures 1A-C) 
- single-cell RNAseq analyses of single-gene transcriptional levels (used in Figures 5B-C, 5G, Figure 6, Supplementary Figures 11-13) 
- single-cell RNAseq RNA velocity and transport potential (used in Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 14).
